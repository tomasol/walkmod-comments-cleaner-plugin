This is a walkmod plugin to remove code that has been temporary commented but developer has forgotten to remove it. 

== Example
Let's see an example. Take a look to this code. 
```java
package example;

import java.util.*;

public class Foo{
  public void goodBye(String s){  
    //System.out.println("bye +"s);
    return "bye +"s;
  }
}
```

What this plugins generates is the following modified code:
```java
package example;

public class Foo{
  public void goodBye(String s){    
    
     return "bye +"s;
  }
}
```

== Usage

Check that your walkmod version is at least 2.2.0. You can add walkmod-comments-cleaner-plugin via walkmod.

  $walkmod add comments-cleaner
  
And then, to see the results 

  $ walkmod apply

Or, you can also check which would be the modified classes typing:

  $ walkmod check
